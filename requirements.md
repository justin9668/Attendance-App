# Project Description

Our project aims to develop a simplified attendance app, similar to TopHat. Leveraging Geolocation API, the app will ensure that students are within the vicinity of the lecture hall to mark attendance, ensuring integrity. Additionally, incorporating a QR code API will allow for a secondary attendance verification, wherein a QR code displayed during the lecture can be scanned by students as proof of attendance. To streamline user access, the app will integrate third-party OAuth for secure authentication using school email accounts. A robust database will be employed to maintain records of users, courses, sessions, and attendance.

# Product Requirements

**Goal**: Develop an attendance app that accurately verifies the presence of students in a course through Geolocation and QR code scanning, with an emphasis on ease of use and security.

**Non-Goal**: The application will not serve as a multipurpose educational platform for assignments, tests, or any non-attendance related activities.

### Non-Functional Requirement 1: Usability

**Functional Requirements**:

- The app must provide a simple and intuitive user interface for both students and lecturers to engage with minimal training.
- The app must be accessible and fully functional on a variety of devices including smartphones, tablets, and computers.

### Non-Functional Requirement 2: Security

**Functional Requirements**:

- Implement OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication using school-provided email accounts to prevent unauthorized access.

# Project Management

**Theme**: Efficient and Secure Attendance Verification

**Epic**: Attendance System Implementation

### User Story 1: As a student, I want to check into my course with one click on my phone, so that I can confirm my attendance without disrupting my focus on the lecture.

**Task**: Implement Geolocation API

**Ticket 1**: Geolocation Accuracy Improvement

- Enhance the precision of the Geolocation API to ensure it accurately reflects the studentsâ€™ presence in the lecture hall.

**Ticket 2**: Geolocation User Interface Design

- Design a user-friendly interface for students check into their courses on the app with seameless geolocation integration.

### User Story 2: As a faculty member, I want a simple way to generate and display a QR code for my lecture, so that I can efficiently track which students are physically present.

**Task**: Implement QR Code Generation and Scanning

**Ticket 1**: QR Code Generation Mechanism

- Develop a system for generating unique QR codes for each course session that can be displayed to students.

**Ticket 2**: QR Code Scanning Integration

- Function within the app that allows students to retrieve and enter the code from the QR code displayed during the lecture for attendance.

# Database

**User Data**: Securely store instructor and student profiles with authentication details.

**Course Data**: Include created or joined courses, location information, and associated course data.

**Attendance Data**: Record attendance timestamps, methods (Geolocation), attendance scores, and attendance status.
